Automated Object Dimension Detection &amp; Packaging Recommendation System
In large-scale delivery operations, selecting the appropriate packaging for various products is a
critical yet challenging task. The current manual process of measuring object dimensions and
choosing the right packaging size often leads to inefficiencies. Incorrect dimension measurements
result in either oversized packaging, which wastes space and increases shipping costs, or
undersized packaging, which can cause product damage during transit. These inefficiencies slow
down operations, increase expenses, and create logistical bottlenecks. Additionally, as companies
scale, the need for automation becomes more urgent to minimize errors, optimize space usage, and
enhance the overall efficiency of packaging processes. Therefore, a solution is required to automate
the dimension detection and packaging recommendation process to save costs, reduce human
error, and improve logistical workflows.
Solution / Approach: 
● Utilize YOLOv5 for real-time object dimension detection through computer vision.
● Automatically recommend optimal packaging sizes based on the detected dimensions,
enhancing efficiency and reducing manual errors
